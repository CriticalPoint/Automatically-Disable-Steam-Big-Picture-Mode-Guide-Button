    <p align="center">
    Annoyed by Steam forcing Big Picture Mode when I press my Xbox Guide button (as you may be too, since you're here), I started about cresating a script that would 'just work' on your Windows PC.
    <br>
    <br>
    I pulled the Steam config apart to find out what's happening, and finally arrived at something that, hopefully, everyone could make use of - a PowerShell script that removes guide button binding at launch (of the Steam Client).
    <br>
    <br>
    #myFirstRepo - explore the code, decide if it's for you, ask questions, fork, chop, poke, chew it up and/or spit it out - it's yours to do with what you will.

<!-- What it does -->
# What it does

You press your Guide button to access Xbox Game Bar (for example) and BAM, Big Picture Mode from nowhere.

You've tried disable it, you've toggled different things off, then on, and back to off but you're getting nowhere... "*Why isn't it working, what am I doing wrong?*"

You've been set-up to fail as Steam re-maps that button at launch and again at exit. It does it a bunch of other times, too (when opening specific option pages), and it just keeps coming back.

It's not you, so you don't need to be forgiven for thinking that switching off a comedy-sized, giant button in the settings menu that says "Guide button focuses Steam", might actually work because, well, no, it doesn't.
<img align="center" src="images/GuideButtonDoes-Not-NotFocusSteam.png" alt="A screenshot of the Steam settings page with the option 'Guide button focuses Steam' highlighted.">

# How is does it
Targeting the SDL config directly ('*guide*' is a non-Steam assignment, so it's unlikely to ever change), the script removes all bindings (from all controllers) in your settings.
It doesn't matter if you're using a PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, aftermarket, off-brand, or other controller - the Guide button will no longer be bound (in Steam) after this file has been run.

*Everything else is unaffected, Game Bar will still work as normal - it's just the Guide button that is unmapped from within Steam*




<!-- PREREQUISITES -->
# Prerequisites

You'll need PowerShell (>v7) to use this script. To check, open up PowerShell and run the below to find your version:
```
$PSVersionTable
```
If you don't have PowerShell 7, see [Installing PowerShell on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)




<!-- USAGE -->
# Usage
## If your Steam directory is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\``` (default)
Go ahead and grab [Guide Unbind - Default Steam Install Location.ps1](https://github.com/CriticalPoint/Remove-Steam-Guide-Button-Bind---Disable-Big-Picture-Mode/blob/main/1%20-%20PS%20SCRIPTS/Guide%20Unbind%20-%20Default%20Steam%20Install%20Location.ps1).

Open Steam and run the script, although you'll likely have to adjust your execution policy...
_Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted_ - Read about [execution policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7.3)

## If you've got Steam installed to a non-standard location
You will need to **edit the file to include your path**, at least until I write another script that finds it automatically (soonish).




<!-- Automation -->
## Automation
This will run the script four seconds after Steam fires up (so after the button is remapped by Steam).

You'll need to:
- Configure a *Scheduled Task*
- Enable [Audit process tracking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/basic-audit-process-tracking), setting an audit 'Success' flag in the Security Policy.
- Either be an admin, or stipulate an admin account for the task to run.

You can either [use the included template](https://github.com/CriticalPoint/Remove-Steam-Guide-Button-Bind---Disable-Big-Picture-Mode/blob/main/Scheduled%20Tasks/Remove%20Steam%20Guide-button%20Assignments.xml) to create your Scheduled Task by updating the tags to match your own and then inmporting it into Task Scheduler...

  - `<Author>` - change this to your PC name and Username `<Author>COMPUTERNAME-CHANGE\ME</Author>`.
  - `<UserId>` - To get your S-1-123456789.... number, run `wmic useraccount get name,sid` in command prompt.
  - `<Arguments>` - Update this with your path to your new Powershell Script `<Arguments>-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\PATH TO SCRIPT\Guide Unbind - Default Steam Install Location.ps1"</Arguments>`

...or you can create the task yourself. Here's how to set it up...


### Set the Trigger
(*Triggers* > *On an Event* > *Custom* > *XML*)

```
<QueryList>
  <Query Id="0" Path="Application">
    <Select Path="Application">
    *[System[Provider[@Name='Application'] and (Level=4 or Level=0) and (EventID=4688)]]
    and 
     *[EventData[Data[@Name='NewProcessName'] and (Data='C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steam.exe')]]
     </Select>
  </Query>
</QueryList>
```



### Set the Action
(*TS/Actions* > *Start a Program*)

'Program/Script'  ```pwsh```

'Arguments'  ```-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\PS\Guide Unbind - Default Steam Install Location.ps1"```
*This assumes the location of the script is in a folder named 'PS', on the root of C. **Update as necessary**.*

### Change Settings
Specify these additional settings, not that *almost* but not all of the options are checked.

* Allow task to be run on demand ‚úÖ
* Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed ‚úÖ
* If the task fails, restart every: *1 Minute* ‚úÖ
* Attempt to restart up to: *3 times* ‚úÖ
* Stop the task if it runs longer than: *1 hour* ‚úÖ
* If the running task does not end when requested, force it to stop ‚úÖ
* If the task is not scheduled to run again, delete it after: ‚ùå (Unchecked)
* If the task is already running, then the following rule applies: *Stop the existing instance* ‚úÖ

A full set of reference screenshots are available - [General](images/taskScheduler/General.png) - [Triggers](images/taskScheduler/Triggers.png) - [Actions](images/taskScheduler/Actions.png) - [Conditions](images/taskScheduler/Conditions.png) - [Settings](images/taskScheduler/Settings.png)

### Save!

You can verify the success of this by first disabling the Task and testing your Guide button in Steam. It should enter BPM.
Now exit Steam, reenable the Task you just created a, opening Steam and testing again. BPM should be fully disabled. If for whatever reason it is not, please either [Raise an Issue](https://github.com/CriticalPoint/Remove-Steam-Guide-Button-Bind---Disable-Big-Picture-Mode/issues), or drop by [Discussions](https://github.com/CriticalPoint/Remove-Steam-Guide-Button-Bind---Disable-Big-Picture-Mode/discussions)

## Changes to the output file

You'll find both copies of the config.vdf in the [diff check of config.vfd](https://github.com/CriticalPoint/Remove-Steam-Guide-Button-Bind---Disable-Big-Picture-Mode/tree/main/diff%20check%20of%20config.vfd) folder - *before-config.vdf*, and *after-config.vdf*.

The final Diff Check (minus all my personal info) is also available, here [Remove all Guide button binds (guide:bxx) from 'config.vdf'](https://www.diffchecker.com/TxvnAz0R/)
